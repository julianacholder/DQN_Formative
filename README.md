## Installation

1. **Create virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv space_env
space_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source casino_env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install gymnasium[atari] stable-baselines3[extra] matplotlib numpy opencv-python ale-py autorom
autorom --accept-license
```

## Usage

### Training the Agent
```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
- Compare CNNPolicy and MLPPolicy (300k timesteps each)
- Automatically select the best performing policy
- Train the winner for full duration (500k timesteps)
- Save the final model as `dqn_model.zip`

### Playing with Trained Agent
```bash
python play.py
```

Options available in play.py:
- Renders the game in real-time
- Plays 3 episodes by default
- Uses greedy policy (deterministic=True)
- Displays episode rewards and step counts

## Hyperparameter Tuning Results

| Hyperparameter Set | Configuration | Observed Behavior |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Benaiah** | lr=1e-4, gamma=0.99, batch_size=32, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.05, epsilon_decay=0.1 | Stable learning with gradual improvement. Agent reached consistent 6-8 point episodes. Conservative play style with reliable enemy avoidance. |
| **Fidel** | lr=5e-4, gamma=0.99, batch_size=32, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.05, epsilon_decay=0.1 | Faster initial learning but volatile performance. High learning rate caused oscillating rewards between 0-15 points. Training instability with periodic performance drops. |
| **Juliana** | lr=2e-4, gamma=0.995, batch_size=64, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.02, epsilon_decay=0.15 | Superior performance with strategic gameplay. Higher gamma encouraged long-term planning resulting in 27-point breakthrough. Extended exploration discovered advanced tactics. |
| **Ines** | lr=3e-4, gamma=0.98, batch_size=16, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.1, epsilon_decay=0.05 | Rapid early adaptation but plateau around 150k timesteps. Small batch size created erratic play patterns. Lower gamma focused on immediate rewards. |

## Results

### Policy Comparison Results

| Policy | Mean Reward | Std Deviation | 
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **CNNPolicy** | 8.80 ± 2.32 | Consistent, reliable performance with low variance |
| **MLPPolicy** | 11.60 ± 9.24 | Higher peak performance but more variable |
| **Final MLP Model** | 8.40 ± 8.72 | Strong performance with breakthrough potential |

### Key Findings

1. **MLPPolicy Superiority:** Contrary to conventional wisdom, MLP outperformed CNN in Space Invaders
2. **Performance Trade-offs:** CNN provided consistency, MLP offered higher peak rewards
3. **Environment-Specific Results:** Space Invaders may favor quick decision-making over spatial processing
